You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It
ain't! YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want
to think of it as a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try
to use XML as a serialization format.

"YAML" is catchy and fun to say. Try it. "YAML, YAML, YAML!!!"
...

# Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML.
print Dump($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
print Dumper($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
