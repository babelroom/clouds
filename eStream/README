Building
========
Generally build like this:
$ make

Install as root:
# make install

The installation comprises core binaries and configuration under
/usr/local/estream

Log and data files are under
/var/estream

Notes
=====
Make sure you have perl REST::Client.pm installed otherwise you'll get an error like:
Can't locate REST/Client.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8 .) at ./FS_out.pl line 13.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./FS_out.pl line 13.

likely resolve with 
yum install perl-CPANPLUS
cpan -i REST::Client

if cpan spins in a loop trying to get geographic information, perhaps run it with a users profile in the environment (i.e su, not su -).
